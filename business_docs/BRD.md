# Business Drivers / Goals

## Context

A U.S.-based commercial bank is pursuing innovation to boost employee productivity using internal Generative AI agents. The bank’s employees (from customer service reps to compliance analysts) spend significant time on repetitive data-gathering and analysis tasks. By providing a secure Generative AI platform (built on Langflow) for internal use, the bank aims to streamline workflows and augment employee decision-making with AI assistants. This platform will enable non-technical staff to create AI-powered workflows (agents) that can, for example, summarize documents, retrieve information from databases, or draft reports, all within a controlled internal environment.

## Market Situation: 
There is a growing enterprise demand for secure, compliant Large Language Model (LLM) platforms in banking. Competitors and fintech firms are exploring AI to improve efficiency, but off-the-shelf solutions often lack the strict security and compliance features banks require. The bank sees an opportunity to leverage an open-source low-code AI workflow builder (Langflow) to get a head start. Langflow is a proven tool for visually building AI agents and workflows that can connect to any model or API, and it can be self-hosted which is critical for data privacy. By adopting Langflow internally, the bank can combine modern AI capabilities with enterprise-grade security, differentiating itself in how it empowers employees while safeguarding sensitive data

# Objectives and Benefits

- Improve Employee Productivity: Automate or accelerate routine tasks (data aggregation, report generation, customer query handling) using AI agents, allowing employees to focus on higher-value analysis and customer interaction.
- Enable Non-Technical AI Development: Provide a visual flow designer interface so that business users with minimal coding experience can create and customize AI workflows. This democratizes AI within the bank, reducing reliance on IT for every solution.
- Department-Specific AI Solutions: Allow different departments (retail banking, corporate banking, compliance, etc.) to build tailored AI agents for their unique use cases within the same unified platform. Examples include a compliance assistant for summarizing regulatory changes, or a customer service FAQ bot for internal use by call center staff.
- Ensure Security & Regulatory Compliance: Design the platform with strict access controls, audit logging, and data encryption to meet U.S. banking regulations (e.g. safeguarding customer information per GLBA, ensuring auditability per SOX). The objective is to leverage AI confidently without compromising on compliance.
- Enterprise Integration: Integrate with the bank’s existing infrastructure (single sign-on, internal data sources, and cloud environment on AWS) to provide a seamless experience. The platform should fit into the bank’s IT ecosystem, enabling AI agents to securely fetch data from internal databases or APIs as permitted.
- Measured ROI and Adoption: Track usage and performance of AI agents (through analytics dashboards) to measure productivity gains. Success is defined by high adoption among employees and tangible time-savings in their workflows within the first year of deployment.

# Overview of Project / BAU

The project will proceed in phases to ensure both quick wins and long-term success. Initially (Project Phase), a core team will stand up the Langflow-based platform on AWS for a pilot program. This includes setting up the infrastructure, implementing required security features, and onboarding a few champion users from each department to create example flows. As the platform stabilizes and proves its value, it will transition into Business-as-Usual (BAU) mode, becoming an ongoing service managed by IT with governance from the compliance team.

## Project Roadmap

1. Phase 1 – Pilot and POC (Q1): Set up the core Langflow platform in a secure AWS environment (internal VPC). Develop a few pilot AI agents (e.g., a compliance Q&A bot, a customer email drafting assistant) to demonstrate value. Collect feedback from pilot users.
2. Phase 2 – Hardening and Compliance (Q2): Integrate enterprise security features – single sign-on authentication, role-based access control, data encryption, and audit logging. Perform risk assessments and ensure the platform meets all U.S. banking regulatory requirements. Also, begin knowledge transfer to IT support teams.
3. Phase 3 – Wider Rollout (Q3): Onboard additional departments. Provide training sessions for employees on using the visual flow designer to create their own AI agents. Gradually scale up the user base. Implement monitoring dashboards for usage and begin measuring productivity improvements.
4. Phase 4 – BAU and Continuous Improvement (Q4 onward): Transition the project to an operational service. IT will handle maintenance (updates to Langflow, model updates, scaling infrastructure) and a governance board will handle ongoing compliance oversight. Continue to gather new use case requirements from business units and enhance the platform (e.g., adding new AI tools or models, fine-tuning prompts for better results).

Throughout these phases, there will be checkpoints with stakeholders (department heads, risk management, IT security) to ensure alignment with business goals and compliance standards. Once in BAU, the platform will be a steady capability of the bank: new AI use cases can be onboarded as needed, and the platform will be maintained as part of the bank’s tech stack (similar to other internal productivity tools).

# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- Visual Flow Creation: The system shall provide a drag-and-drop flow designer that allows users to create AI workflows (agents) by connecting components such as LLMs, tools (e.g. database query, calculator), and memory modules. Users should be able to visually configure prompts, chain logic, and agent behavior without coding (Langflow’s visual builder and component interface will serve this need).
- Library of AI Components: The platform shall include a library of pre-built components representing common AI functions: various LLMs (GPT-4, etc.), vector store connectors, prompt templates, data loaders, and custom tools. It must support all major LLM models and vector databases out-of-the-box, so users have flexibility in choosing AI capabilities.
- User Authentication & Role Management: The platform shall integrate with the bank’s authentication system (e.g., Active Directory/SSO) so that only authorized employees can access it. There shall be at least two roles – Designer (User) who can create and run flows, and Administrator who can manage the system (user provisioning, component approvals, monitoring). The system must enforce role-based access controls such that, for example, only Admins can deploy global changes or view other departments’ flows.
- Departmental Workspaces: It shall allow segregation of content by department or team. A user should by default see and manage only the flows they created or that belong to their department’s workspace. Sharing of flows between users or departments should be possible only through explicit action and with proper permissions, ensuring sensitive workflows are not visible to unintended audiences.
- Flow Execution and API Exposure: Users must be able to execute their AI flows on demand from the UI (for testing in a playground) and see results step-by-step. Additionally, the platform shall turn each saved flow into an API endpoint (with appropriate authentication) so it can be triggered by external systems or scripts. For example, if operations builds a “report generator” flow, they can call it via an API from a scheduling tool to run nightly.

- Integration with Internal Data Sources: The platform should allow integration of internal APIs and databases into flows. This may be achieved by providing custom components or connectors that IT can develop (for example, a component to query an internal Oracle DB or an API to fetch customer data). Users can then include these components in their flows, subject to access rules (e.g., only certain roles can use a “customer data” component).

- Logging and Audit Trail: Every action (flow creation, modification, execution, and deletion) and every AI agent interaction (prompts and responses) shall be logged. Authorized users (e.g., compliance officers or admins) should be able to view an audit trail of who ran which flow, when, and what data was processed. This is critical for compliance auditing and investigating any issues (such as an AI output that might have used sensitive info).

- Monitoring Dashboard: Provide a built-in dashboard or integrate with an existing monitoring tool to track usage metrics: number of flows created, execution frequency, errors, and performance. This could integrate with Langflow’s observability features or third-party tools. For example, leveraging Langflow’s support for LangSmith or LangFuse for tracing to monitor and debug agent behavior in detail.

- Notifications & Error Handling: If a flow fails (due to an error or a policy violation), the system should notify the user and log the incident. Administrators might receive alerts for critical failures or security-related events (like an unauthorized access attempt). Users should get feedback in the UI when something goes wrong (e.g., “Your flow attempted to access a restricted data source and was blocked”), helping them correct the issue.

- Flow Lifecycle Management: Users should be able to save versions of their flows (version control), publish a flow for others in their department to use, or retire flows that are no longer needed. Before a flow is published for wider use, it might require an admin review step (especially if it uses sensitive data or high compute resources).

- Scheduled and Batch Runs: Beyond interactive use, the platform should allow scheduling flows or running them on a batch of inputs. For example, a user could schedule a compliance-check agent to run daily, or run a customer-email-generating agent on a list of 100 inputs. This might be achieved via the API integration (external scheduler calls the flow’s API) or a built-in scheduler component.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Security & Compliance: The platform must comply with U.S. banking regulations regarding data security and privacy. This includes encryption of data at-rest and in-transit (e.g., using AWS KMS-managed keys for storage, enforcing HTTPS for all connections), secure key management (API keys or credentials for external LLMs stored in AWS Secrets Manager or an equivalent secure vault), and strict network isolation (hosted in a private VPC with no public internet access except through vetted egress points). All user interactions and AI outputs should be considered sensitive by default and handled accordingly.
- Access Control & Auditing: Role-based access control (RBAC) is mandatory. Only authorized personnel can access certain features (for example, only Compliance or Admin roles can retrieve conversation logs of all users). The system should integrate with the bank’s identity management (such as SSO with MFA) to authenticate users. Every user action should produce an audit log entry. Auditing capabilities must support retention of logs as per banking policy (e.g., keep logs for at least 1 year for compliance review) and logs should be tamper-evident.
- Scalability: The solution should scale to hundreds of users and concurrent AI agent executions. On the backend, it will utilize a scalable architecture (containerized microservices, auto-scaling groups, or Kubernetes on AWS) so that as usage grows, more compute can be added. The use of a robust database (PostgreSQL in place of the default SQLite) ensures the system can handle concurrent edits and large numbers of saved flows without performance degradation. The design should support scaling out horizontally – e.g., running multiple worker processes for executing flows in parallel.
- Performance: Interactions with the AI agents should be reasonably responsive. For instance, for a typical query, the platform should return an answer within a few seconds (assuming the underlying LLM call is fast). The UI should remain responsive even when flows become complex (caching component metadata, efficient diff updates to the flow graph). The system should be tested to handle peak loads (e.g., many users running flows simultaneously during business hours) with defined performance KPIs (like 95th percentile response time).
- High Availability & Disaster Recovery: The platform should be highly available, targeting at least 99.9% uptime, given it may become critical for daily operations. Deployment on AWS should leverage multi-AZ (Availability Zone) redundancy for the application servers and database. Regular backups of the database (flow definitions, user data) must be taken, and in case of a major outage or disaster, the RTO (Recovery Time Objective) should be minimal (e.g., < 4 hours to restore service in a worst-case scenario). The system should tolerate failures (e.g., if one AI model API is down, it fails gracefully or uses a fallback model).
- Maintainability: Given it’s based on Langflow (open-source), our deployment must be maintainable by internal IT. All custom configurations or extensions (like added security layers, custom components) should be well-documented. We will follow best practices for infrastructure-as-code (e.g., using Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for AWS resources) and CI/CD for updates. Upgrading Langflow to newer versions should be possible with minimal downtime; any forks of the code for custom features should be tracked to facilitate merging upstream changes.
- Usability and Training: The platform’s UI should remain intuitive (Langflow’s interface is already user-friendly by design). Still, internal documentation or help should be provided. The system should include tooltips or help sections for each component so users understand how to use them. Additionally, ensure the platform is accessible (adhering to accessibility standards where possible) and works on standard browsers used internally.
- Data Privacy: If any personal data or customer data is used in flows, the system must ensure that such data is not sent to external services without approval. For instance, if using an external LLM API (like OpenAI), there must be confirmation that no confidential PII is in the prompt, or an internal approval mechanism to allow that usage. Ideally, the platform would favor use of internal AI models (or ones hosted in the bank’s cloud) for sensitive data. Compliance with privacy laws (like GDPR for any personal data of EU customers, etc.) should be considered – e.g., ability to delete data upon request if ever the platform stored any.
- Compliance Monitoring: The platform itself should facilitate compliance checks – e.g., allowing the compliance team to periodically review the flows created to ensure none violates policy (for example, a flow that attempts to send data externally would be flagged). Non-functional compliance includes following guidelines such as FFIEC IT Examination Handbook for AI usage, and ensuring the system can produce evidence for auditors on how AI decisions are made (traceability of prompts, model versions, etc.).
- Interoperability: The system should be flexible to work with various LLM providers and tools. If in the future the bank chooses to switch from one LLM API to another (say from OpenAI to an AWS Bedrock model), the architecture should support that swap with minimal changes to user-created flows. This implies using abstraction in the component design (which Langflow provides) so that components like “LLM” can be pointed to different backends without users having to rebuild flows. It also should integrate smoothly with DevOps pipelines if needed (for example, enabling version control export of flows as JSON, which Langflow supports).

# Scope of Work

## In Scope

- Development of the Langflow-Based Platform: Setting up Langflow on AWS and extending it as needed to meet the bank’s requirements (security hardening, RBAC integration, etc.). This includes both the Langflow IDE for flow design and a headless runtime for executing flows in production.
- Infrastructure Setup on AWS: Provisioning of necessary AWS components (VPC, subnets, Load Balancer/API Gateway, EC2/EKS for the app, RDS for PostgreSQL database, S3 for file storage, ElastiCache for Redis caching, Cognito or integration with internal SSO for user auth, CloudWatch for logging/monitoring, etc.). Ensure the AWS environment is configured according to the bank’s cloud security guidelines.
- User Access Management: Integration with the bank’s user directories or AWS Cognito user pool to manage authentication. Implementation of role-based access control within the application (Admins vs regular users, and department-level permissions).
- Feature Customization: Development of any needed custom components or integrations for the bank. For example, if Langflow does not natively support a certain database, building a custom node that allows the AI agent to query that database (with proper secure credentials). Also, customizing the UI as needed to incorporate the bank’s branding or additional help text about internal policies.
- Testing and Compliance Checks: Thorough testing of the platform’s functionalities (unit testing of components, integration testing for end-to-end flows, load testing for concurrency) as well as security testing (vulnerability scanning, penetration testing focused on the new features). Also included is the review process with compliance and risk teams to sign off that the platform meets regulatory requirements.
- Documentation & Training Materials: Creating user guides for employees to learn how to create flows, admin guides for how to manage the system, and compliance guidelines for acceptable use of the AI platform. Training sessions or train-the-trainer workshops are also in scope to ensure adoption.
- Initial Use Case Implementation: Assisting a few departments in building the first set of AI agents (e.g., a compliance report generator, a customer service knowledge base Q&A bot, a financial analysis assistant). This will serve both as a proof of concept and as templates for others. These use cases will be fully implemented and validated on the platform during the project.
- Launch and Support Handover: Deployment of the platform for production use and a period of hypercare support after launch (e.g., the project team will closely monitor for a few weeks to address any issues). Handover to the internal IT operations team is included, with knowledge transfer on maintenance tasks and troubleshooting.

## Out of Scope

- External Customer-Facing AI Tools: The scope is strictly internal. Using this platform to deploy AI features directly to external bank customers (e.g., integrating into the public website or mobile app for customers) is out of scope. Such use would require additional considerations (like customer data privacy, model bias concerns, etc.) and is not planned in this project.
- Development of New LLM Models: This project will use existing LLMs (whether via API or on-prem hosted). Training or significantly fine-tuning new large language models is out of scope. The platform focuses on orchestration of AI and data components, not creating new AI models from scratch.
- Replacement of Core Banking Systems: The platform is an auxiliary tool to assist employees and is not meant to replace any core transaction processing or record-keeping system. For instance, it won’t replace the core compliance monitoring system or the CRM; rather, it may interface with them. Any such core system overhaul or legacy system modifications are out of scope.
- Data Source Creation: While integration to data sources is in scope, the project will not create new data warehouses or unify data across silos beyond the needs of the AI flows. It will use existing data sources. Broader data engineering tasks (like building new databases or cleaning large datasets for AI consumption) are separate initiatives.
- Ongoing Operational Staffing: After the handover, the ongoing staffing (dedicated support team or additional hires to maintain the system) is out of scope of the project budget/timeline. The expectation is that existing IT staff will absorb those responsibilities in BAU. The project will not fund a permanent new team indefinitely – it focuses on setup and transition.
- Non-Internal Use Compliance (non-US Jurisdictions): Ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations is in scope, but adapting the platform for use in other countries’ regulatory environments is not (e.g., if later the bank’s international branches want to use it, that would be a separate effort to address those local regulations).
