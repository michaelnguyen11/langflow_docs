## Key Documentation Categories

### Architecture Documentation

The architecture documentation provides high-level overviews of Langflow's major subsystems:

- **Architecture Overview**: Overall system architecture and design philosophy
- **Component System**: Design of the component-based architecture
- **Flow Engine**: Design of the flow execution engine
- **API and Services**: Overview of the service layer and external interfaces
- **C4 Model Diagrams**: Structured architecture visualization at different abstraction levels

### Implementation Documentation

Implementation documentation provides more detailed information about how specific parts of the system are built:

- **Backend Documentation**: Python/FastAPI backend implementation details, including sequence diagrams for key processes
- **Frontend Documentation**: React/TypeScript frontend implementation details, including state management

### Deployment Documentation

Information about deploying Langflow in different environments:

- **Deployment Architecture**: General deployment considerations
- **AWS Deployment**: Specific AWS deployment architecture

## Reading Recommendations

1. Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture/architecture_overview.md) for a high-level understanding
2. Explore the component system through [Component System](architecture/component_system.md)
3. Learn about flow processing via [Flow Engine](architecture/flow_engine.md)
4. Review C4 model diagrams in the [architecture/c4](architecture/c4/) directory for visual architecture representations
5. Dive into backend and frontend implementation details as needed

## Extending the Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions
2. Place diagram documentation in the same directory as the corresponding implementation documentation
3. Link to related documentation files where appropriate
4. Include diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
5. Focus on clarity and accuracy over length
6. Update this README.md if creating new categories or significant sections
