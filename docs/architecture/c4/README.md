# C4 Model Diagrams

This directory contains documentation for the C4 model diagrams that describe the Langflow architecture.

## What is the C4 Model?

The C4 model is a simple but powerful approach for visualizing software architecture at different levels of abstraction. It was created by Simon Brown and consists of a hierarchical set of software architecture diagrams for context, containers, components, and code.

The "C4" stands for:
- **Context** - System context diagram
- **Containers** - Container diagram
- **Components** - Component diagram
- **Code** - Code diagram (optional)

## Diagrams in this Directory

- [C4 Context Diagram](c4_context_diagram.md) - Shows the big picture - Langflow and its relationships with users and other systems
- [C4 Container Diagram](c4_container_diagram.md) - Zooms into Langflow to show the high-level technical building blocks (containers)
- [C4 Component Diagram](c4_component_diagram.md) - Zooms into individual containers to show their components
- [C4 Code Diagram](c4_code_diagram.md) - Provides detailed implementation details of key components
- [C4 Frontend Component Diagram](c4_frontend_component_diagram.md) - Detailed view of the frontend component architecture

## Purpose of C4 Diagrams

These diagrams provide a standardized way to communicate the architecture of Langflow, from a high-level overview down to implementation details. They help both technical and non-technical stakeholders understand the system at an appropriate level of detail.
