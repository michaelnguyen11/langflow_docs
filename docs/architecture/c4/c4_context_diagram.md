# C4 Context Diagram for Langflow

## Overview

The C4 Context diagram provides a high-level view of the Langflow system, showing how it interacts with users and external systems. This diagram serves as an entry point to understanding the overall system architecture.

## Diagram Elements

### People

- **User**: End users who interact with Langflow to create and deploy AI workflows.
- **Administrator**: System administrators who manage user accounts and system configurations.
- **Developer**: Technical users who integrate with Langflow APIs.

### Internal Systems

- **Component System**: The core system managing all AI components and their interfaces. This is the central part of Langflow responsible for handling language models, agents, chains, and other AI components.
- **Flow Engine**: The system responsible for executing workflow graphs built with components.
- **API Layer**: The interface that provides REST endpoints for frontend and external application interaction.

### External Systems

- **LLM Provider**: External Large Language Model providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- **Vector Database**: External vector storage solutions like Pinecone, Chroma, etc.
- **External Data Source**: Sources of documents and data that can be integrated with flows.
- **Monitoring Tools**: External monitoring and observability tools like LangSmith, LangFuse, etc.
- **External Application**: Any third-party application that uses Langflow APIs.

## Key Relationships

- Users interact with Langflow through the API Layer to create and manage AI workflows.
- Administrators configure the system through the API Layer.
- Developers integrate with Langflow APIs.
- The API Layer communicates with the Component System to manage components and the Flow Engine to execute flows.
- The Flow Engine uses the Component System to create and connect components during execution.
- The Component System integrates with external services like LLM providers, vector databases, and data sources.
- External applications consume Langflow APIs.

## Purpose

This diagram helps stakeholders understand:

- The major users and their interactions with the system
- The primary components within Langflow
- The external systems that Langflow integrates with
- The role of the Component System as the core of the architecture
