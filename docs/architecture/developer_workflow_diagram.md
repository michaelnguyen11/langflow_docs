  - Write tests
  - Update documentation

- **Testing**: Testing procedures and workflows.
  - Run unit tests
  - Run integration tests
  - Perform manual testing
  - Validate against requirements

- **Code Review**: Process for reviewing and merging code.
  - Submit pull request
  - Address review comments
  - Get approval
  - Merge to main branch

- **Release Process**: Steps for releasing new versions.
  - Version bump
