# Langflow Authentication Middleware Sequence Diagram

## Overview

This sequence diagram illustrates the authentication process implemented in Langflow's backend as middleware. It shows how JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication is handled, from receiving the client request to either rejecting unauthorized access or forwarding authenticated requests to the appropriate route handler.

## Participants

- **Client**: The entity making API requests to the Langflow backend
- **FastAPI App**: The main FastAPI application that receives HTTP requests
- **Auth Middleware**: The middleware component responsible for authentication
- **Auth Service**: The service that contains authentication logic
- **Settings Service**: Provides configuration settings for authentication
- **Database**: Stores user information
- **Route Handler**: The final endpoint that processes the authenticated request

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Initial Request Processing

```
Client → FastAPI App: HTTP Request with JWT
FastAPI App → Auth Middleware: process_request()
```

The client sends an HTTP request containing a JWT in the authorization header, which is passed to the Auth Middleware.

### 2. Token Extraction

```
Auth Middleware → Auth Middleware: extract_token_from_header()
```

The middleware extracts the JWT from the request header.

### 3. Decision Point: Token Presence

If no token is found:
```
Auth Middleware → Client: 401 Unauthorized
```

If a token is found, processing continues.

### 4. Token Validation

```
Auth Middleware → Auth Service: validate_token(token)
Auth Service → Settings Service: get_jwt_settings()
Settings Service → Auth Service: jwt_settings
Auth Service → Auth Service: decode_jwt(token, settings)
```

The Auth Service validates the token using the JWT settings (secret key, algorithm, etc.).

### 5. Decision Point: Token Validity

If the token is invalid:
```
Auth Service → Auth Middleware: Validation error
Auth Middleware → Client: 401 Unauthorized
```

If the token is valid, processing continues.

### 6. User Verification

```
Auth Service → Database: get_user(user_id)
Database → Auth Service: user_data
```

The system retrieves the user data associated with the user ID from the token.

### 7. Decision Point: User Existence

If the user is not found:
```
Auth Service → Auth Middleware: User not found
Auth Middleware → Client: 401 Unauthorized
```

If the user is found, processing continues.

### 8. Request Forwarding

```
Auth Service → Auth Middleware: Valid user
Auth Middleware → Auth Middleware: set_user_context()
Auth Middleware → Route Handler: forward_request()
```

The middleware sets the user context (making user information available to routes) and forwards the request.

### 9. Request Processing and Response

```
Route Handler → Route Handler: process_request()
Route Handler → Auth Middleware: response
Auth Middleware → FastAPI App: Return response
FastAPI App → Client: HTTP Response
```

The route handler processes the request and returns a response that flows back to the client.

## Key Features

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Uses industry-standard JWT for secure authentication
- **Middleware Architecture**: Authentication as a cross-cutting concern
- **Early Rejection**: Unauthorized requests are rejected before reaching route handlers
- **User Context**: Authenticated user information is attached to the request context
- **Configuration-driven**: Authentication parameters come from a settings service

## Implementation Notes

- JWT tokens contain encoded user information and an expiration time
- The system uses asymmetric or symmetric cryptography for token signing/verification
- User context is set using FastAPI dependency injection
- Access control for specific endpoints can build on this authentication layer
- The middleware fails fast on authentication errors to optimize performance
