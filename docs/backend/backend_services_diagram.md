# Backend Services Diagram

## Overview

The Backend Services Diagram provides a comprehensive view of Langflow's backend service architecture. This diagram illustrates how different services are organized into logical groups, their relationships, and how they interact with each other and external systems.

## Diagram Purpose

This C4 component diagram serves to:
- Show the logical organization of backend services
- Illustrate how services are grouped by functionality
- Demonstrate service dependencies and interactions
- Clarify the connections between services and external systems

## Key Service Groups

### Core Services

1. **Flow Service**
   - Manages flow CRUD operations
   - Handles flow storage and retrieval

2. **Component Service**
   - Manages component metadata and discovery
   - Provides component information to the frontend

3. **Auth Service**
   - Handles authentication and authorization
   - Manages user permissions

4. **Execution Service**
   - Manages flow execution
   - Tracks execution status

5. **File Service**
   - Handles file operations
   - Manages uploads and downloads

6. **Store Service**
   - Manages component marketplace
   - Handles component sharing

### Engine Services

1. **Component System**
   - Core component management system
   - Handles component registration and instantiation

2. **Flow Engine**
   - Graph processing and execution
   - Determines execution order

3. **Event Manager**
   - System event handling
   - Publishes and subscribes to events

4. **Tracing Service**
   - Execution tracing and logging
   - Provides observability

### Data Services

1. **Database Service**
   - Database access layer
   - Handles persistence operations

2. **Cache Service**
   - Caching layer
   - Improves performance

3. **Migration Service**
   - Database migrations
   - Manages schema evolution

### Integration Services

1. **LangChain Service**
   - Integration with LangChain library
   - Provides access to LangChain capabilities

2. **LLM Service**
   - Integration with LLM providers
   - Manages API keys and rate limits

3. **Vector Service**
   - Integration with vector databases
   - Handles vector operations

4. **Custom Integration Service**
   - Support for custom integrations
   - Enables third-party extensions

## Key Relationships

The diagram illustrates these important relationships:

- Frontend calls the API Layer through REST API
- API Layer uses various Core Services
- Core Services use Data Services for persistence
- Execution Service uses Flow Engine for execution
- Component Service uses Component System for management
- Flow Engine creates and connects components using Component System
- Engine Services publish events through Event Manager
- Integration Services connect to External Services
- Data Services interact with the Database

## External Systems

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React/TypeScript user interface

2. **Database**
   - SQLite/PostgreSQL persistent storage

3. **External Services**
   - LLMs, Vector DBs, and third-party APIs

## How to Use This Diagram

This diagram helps different stakeholders understand the service architecture:

- **For Developers**: Understand service boundaries and dependencies
- **For Architects**: Evaluate the system's modularity and cohesion
- **For DevOps**: Plan deployment and scaling strategies
- **For Technical Leads**: Identify potential areas for improvement

## Rendering the Diagram

To generate this diagram from the PlantUML source:

1. Use the PlantUML online server: paste the contents of `backend_services_diagram.puml` at http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/
2. Use a local PlantUML installation: `java -jar plantuml.jar backend_services_diagram.puml`
3. Use VS Code with the PlantUML extension: open the file and preview
