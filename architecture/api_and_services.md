# Langflow API and Services

## API Overview

Langflow provides a comprehensive REST API that powers the frontend and enables integration with external applications. The API follows RESTful principles and uses JSON for data exchange.

## API Endpoints

The API is organized into several categories:

### Flow Management

- `GET /api/v1/flows`: List all flows
- `POST /api/v1/flows`: Create a new flow
- `GET /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}`: Get a specific flow
- `PUT /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}`: Update a flow
- `DELETE /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}`: Delete a flow
- `POST /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/duplicate`: Duplicate a flow

### Flow Execution

- `POST /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/execute`: Execute a flow
- `POST /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/predict`: Run prediction with a flow
- `POST /api/v1/flows/chat/{flow_id}`: Interactive chat with a flow
- `GET /api/v1/flows/status/{flow_id}`: Get flow execution status

### Component Information

- `GET /api/v1/components`: List all component types
- `GET /api/v1/components/{component_type}`: Get component details

### User Management

- `POST /api/v1/login`: User login
- `POST /api/v1/logout`: User logout
- `POST /api/v1/users`: Create a new user
- `GET /api/v1/users/me`: Get current user info
- `PUT /api/v1/users/me`: Update user info

### File Management

- `POST /api/v1/files/upload`: Upload a file
- `GET /api/v1/files/{file_id}`: Download a file
- `DELETE /api/v1/files/{file_id}`: Delete a file

### Utilities

- `GET /health`: Health check
- `GET /api/v1/version`: Get API version info
- `GET /api/v1/logs`: Get application logs

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication:

- Login endpoint returns an access token and refresh token
- Access token must be included in Authorization header
- Refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token
- Token validation occurs on protected endpoints

## Request/Response Format

API requests and responses use JSON format:

### Request Example

```json
POST /api/v1/flows
{
  "name": "My Flow",
  "description": "A sample flow",
  "data": {
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...]
  }
}
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "id": "flow-123",
  "name": "My Flow",
  "description": "A sample flow",
  "data": {
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...]
  },
  "created_at": "2023-06-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-06-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Error Handling

API errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message",
  "error_code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "status_code": 400
}
```

Common error codes include:

- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Invalid input data
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Authentication required
- `FORBIDDEN`: Permission denied
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Server error

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- Limits are based on IP address and/or user ID
- Rate limit headers are included in responses
- Exceeded limits return 429 Too Many Requests

## Services Architecture

Langflow employs a service-oriented architecture where core functionality is encapsulated in services:

### Settings Service

- Manages application configuration
- Handles environment variables
- Controls feature flags
- Sets system defaults

### Database Service

- Manages database connections
- Implements data access layer
- Handles migrations
- Provides transaction support

### Auth Service

- Manages user authentication
- Handles JWT creation and validation
- Implements role-based access control
- Integrates with external auth providers

### Queue Service

- Manages background tasks
- Handles long-running operations
- Implements job scheduling
- Provides status tracking

### Telemetry Service

- Collects usage statistics
- Tracks performance metrics
- Handles error reporting
- Supports observability

### File Service

- Manages file uploads and downloads
- Handles temporary storage
- Provides access control for files
- Supports different storage backends

## Service Dependencies

Services follow a dependency injection pattern:

- Services are initialized at application startup
- Dependencies are explicitly defined
- Configuration is passed to services
- Services are accessed through dependency providers

## Background Tasks

Long-running operations are handled as background tasks:

- Tasks are queued for asynchronous execution
- Status updates are provided
- Results are stored for later retrieval
- Cancellation is supported

## Service Configuration

Services are configured through:

- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Database settings
- Command-line arguments

## API Documentation

The API is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger):

- Interactive documentation available at `/docs`
- OpenAPI schema at `/openapi.json`
- Examples for each endpoint
- Authentication information

## API Versioning

The API uses URL versioning:

- `/api/v1/` for the current version
- New versions are introduced as needed
- Backward compatibility is maintained when possible
