# Langflow Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Langflow is a powerful tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. It provides a visual authoring experience and a built-in API server that enables the creation of AI workflows with little to no code. Langflow supports all major LLMs, vector databases, and a growing library of AI tools.

## Key Features

1. **Visual Builder**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for quick creation and iteration of AI workflows
2. **Code Access**: Ability to customize components using Python code
3. **Playground**: Interactive testing environment with step-by-step control
4. **Multi-agent Orchestration**: Tools for managing conversations between multiple AI agents
5. **API Deployment**: Automatic conversion of flows into API endpoints
6. **Observability**: Integrations with monitoring tools like LangSmith and LangFuse
7. **Enterprise-ready**: Security and scalability features for production deployment

## High-Level Architecture

Langflow follows a client-server architecture with clear separation between the frontend and backend:

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Single-page application built with React and TypeScript
- Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability
- Flow-based interface implemented using React Flow for visual workflow building
- State management using React contexts and stores
- Responsive design for different device sizes

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- REST API built with FastAPI
- Modular component system for different AI capabilities
- Database integration using SQLAlchemy
- Alembic for database migrations
- Service-oriented architecture for key functionality
- Asynchronous processing for background tasks

### Database
- Storage for flows, users, and component configurations
- Support for multiple database backends

### Integration Layer
- Connectors for LLMs (LangChain integration)
- Vector database connectors
- External service integrations

## Core Concepts

### Flows
Flows are visual representations of AI workflows composed of interconnected nodes. Each flow can be tested, modified, and deployed as an API endpoint.

### Components
Components are the building blocks of Langflow, representing different AI capabilities like LLMs, chains, agents, and tools. Components are organized into categories and can be connected through inputs and outputs.

### Services
Backend services handle authentication, flow execution, background processing, and other key functionality.

## Deployment Options

Langflow can be deployed in multiple ways:
- Self-hosted using Docker
- Cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Fully-managed by DataStax
