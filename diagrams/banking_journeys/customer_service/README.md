### AI-Assisted Customer Service System Development

The sequence diagram [`ai_assisted_customer_service.puml`](./ai_assisted_customer_service.puml) shows the complete journey for developing an AI-assisted customer service system within a banking organization using Langflow.

The diagram illustrates:
- How business analysts define customer service use cases
- How AI architects design flows for customer service
- How developers implement custom banking components
- How compliance officers ensure regulatory compliance
- How operations staff utilize the system with customers

The diagram is divided into four main phases:
1. **Requirements & Design Phase** - Initial definition of needs and design of the solution
2. **Development & Integration Phase** - Development of components and integration with banking systems
3. **Compliance & Testing Phase** - Regulatory testing and compliance validation
4. **Deployment & Operations Phase** - Production deployment and customer interactions
