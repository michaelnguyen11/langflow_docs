# Banking Component Development Journeys

This directory contains sequence diagrams related to banking-specific component development for the Langflow platform.

## Diagrams

### Banking Component Development

The sequence diagram [`banking_component_development.puml`](./banking_component_development.puml) shows the complete journey for developing custom banking components for Langflow.

The diagram illustrates:
- How developers set up their development environment
- How business analysts define banking component requirements
- How developers implement banking-specific functionality
- How compliance officers ensure regulatory adherence
- How components are tested, approved, and deployed

The diagram is divided into four main phases:
1. **Setup & Requirements Phase** - Environment setup and requirements gathering
2. **Component Development Phase** - Implementation of banking-specific component logic
3. **UI Development Phase** - Creation of component user interface elements
4. **Testing & Compliance Phase** - Unit testing and regulatory compliance validation
5. **Documentation & Deployment Phase** - Documentation, deployment, and usage

## Banking Roles Represented

Key banking roles featured in these diagrams:

- **Developer** - Implements custom banking components
- **AI Architect** - Reviews component designs and approves for production
- **Business Analyst** - Defines requirements and uses components in solutions
- **Compliance Officer** - Ensures components meet regulatory requirements

## Banking Components Use Cases

Potential banking-specific components that can be developed using this workflow:

- **KYC/AML Verification** - Components for customer verification and anti-money laundering
- **Fraud Detection** - Real-time transaction fraud analysis components
- **Customer Profiling** - Components that analyze customer behavior patterns
- **Risk Scoring** - Banking-specific risk assessment components
- **Regulatory Reporting** - Components that generate required regulatory reports
- **Secure Document Processing** - Banking document extraction with PII protection
