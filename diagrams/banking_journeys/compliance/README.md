# Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Journeys

This directory contains sequence diagrams related to regulatory compliance monitoring in a banking context.

## Diagrams

### Regulatory Compliance Monitoring System Development

The sequence diagram [`regulatory_compliance_monitoring.puml`](./regulatory_compliance_monitoring.puml) shows the complete journey for developing a regulatory compliance monitoring system within a banking organization using Langflow.

The diagram illustrates:
- How compliance officers define regulatory requirements
- How AI architects design flows for continuous compliance monitoring
- How developers implement document processing and policy matching
- How risk managers define risk thresholds and alerts
- How the system monitors live transactions for compliance issues

The diagram is divided into four main phases:
1. **Requirements & Design Phase** - Initial definition of compliance needs and solution design
2. **Development & Integration Phase** - Development of regulatory components and integrations
3. **Risk Configuration & Testing Phase** - Setting up risk thresholds and testing with historical data
4. **Deployment & Operations Phase** - Production deployment and continuous compliance monitoring

## Banking Roles Represented

Key banking roles featured in these diagrams:

- **Compliance Officer** - Defines regulatory requirements and reviews compliance results
- **AI Architect** - Designs AI-enabled compliance monitoring flows
- **Developer** - Implements document processing and policy matching components
- **Risk Manager** - Defines risk thresholds and approves risk parameters

## Regulatory Considerations

The sequence diagram shows how Langflow can be configured to address key banking regulatory requirements:

- **Transaction Monitoring** - Continuous monitoring of banking transactions
- **Document Processing** - Automated analysis of documents for regulatory compliance
- **Audit Trail** - Comprehensive logging of all compliance checks
- **Alerting System** - Real-time alerts for potential compliance issues
- **Regulatory Reporting** - Evidence collection and reporting capabilities
