### Regulatory Compliance Monitoring

The [Regulatory Compliance Monitoring](regulatory_compliance_monitoring.puml) diagram shows how compliance officers and risk analysts leverage Langflow to implement automated compliance monitoring systems.

This is primarily an implementation of the **API Integration Journey** applied to regulatory compliance in banking:

Key phases include:
- **Compliance System Setup** - Configuring the compliance monitoring system
- **Rule Definition** - Creating regulatory rules and detection patterns
- **Data Integration** - Connecting to transaction and customer data
- **Monitoring Implementation** - Setting up continuous monitoring
- **Alert Management** - Handling potential compliance issues
- **Reporting** - Generating compliance documentation and evidence
- **Audit Support** - Facilitating regulatory audits

## Relation to Core Journey

This implementation demonstrates how the general API Integration Journey is adapted for compliance teams in banking. It shows:

1. How the abstract integration steps are applied to compliance-specific systems
2. The additional security and audit requirements in compliance contexts
3. The specific regulatory components and patterns needed
4. How banking data is integrated with Langflow for compliance monitoring
5. The specialized reporting and alerting needs of compliance teams
