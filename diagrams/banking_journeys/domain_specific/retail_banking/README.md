### AI-Assisted Customer Service

The [AI-Assisted Customer Service](ai_assisted_customer_service.puml) diagram shows how branch representatives and relationship managers use Langflow to assist retail banking customers.

This is an implementation of the **Flow Designer Journey** applied to customer service in retail banks:

Key phases include:
- **Login and Authentication** - Bank representatives accessing the Langflow platform
- **Customer Inquiry** - Processing and classifying customer questions
- **AI-Assisted Response** - Generating compliant, personalized recommendations
- **Transaction Processing** - Executing banking transactions with AI assistance
- **Document Generation** - Creating banking documentation with AI
- **Complex Case Escalation** - Handling special cases requiring expert input
- **Performance Monitoring** - Branch managers tracking service performance

## Relation to Core Journey

This implementation demonstrates how the general Flow Designer Journey is applied to a specific banking role and use case. It shows:

1. How the abstract steps in the core journey map to specific banking activities
2. The banking-specific components and terminology
3. How banking requirements like compliance are integrated
4. The specific actors and systems involved in retail banking
