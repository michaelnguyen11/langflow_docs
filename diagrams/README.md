# Langflow Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains a collection of C4 architecture diagrams that document the Langflow system's architecture, with a focus on the Backend Component System.

## Diagram Types

The architecture is documented through several complementary diagrams:

### Backend Architecture

1. [**Backend Component Diagram**](docs/backend_component_diagram.md)
   - High-level view of the major components in the Langflow backend
   - Shows relationships between the API, Component System, Flow Engine, and supporting services

2. [**Backend Services Diagram**](docs/backend_services_diagram.md)
   - Detailed organization of backend services into functional groups
   - Illustrates dependencies and interactions between service groups

### Component System

3. [**Component System Diagram**](docs/component_system_diagram.md)
   - Focused view of the Component System's internal structure
   - Shows key elements like Registry, Scanner, Factory, and Type Extractor

4. [**Component System Architecture**](docs/component_system_architecture.md)
   - Comprehensive view of the Component System architecture
   - Detailed organization of component types and supporting infrastructure

### Implementation Details

5. [**Component Class Diagram**](docs/component_class_diagram.md)
   - Code-level view of the Component System class structure
   - Shows inheritance relationships and key methods

6. [**Component Execution Sequence**](docs/component_execution_sequence.md)
   - Dynamic sequence showing the flow of component execution
   - Illustrates interactions between different parts of the system during execution

## Viewing the Diagrams

These diagrams are created using PlantUML. To render them:

1. **Online Rendering**: Use the PlantUML online server at http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/
2. **Local Installation**: Run `java -jar plantuml.jar filename.puml` with a local PlantUML installation
3. **IDE Integration**: Use VS Code with the PlantUML extension or other IDE plugins
4. **CI/CD Tools**: Many CI/CD pipelines support automatic PlantUML rendering

## Diagram Organization

The diagrams follow the C4 model hierarchy, providing views at different levels of abstraction:

- **Context Level**: System context and external interactions
- **Container Level**: Major system components and their relationships
- **Component Level**: Internal structure of specific components
- **Code Level**: Class relationships and implementation details

## Documentation

Each diagram has accompanying documentation that explains:

- The diagram's purpose and scope
- Key elements and their functions
- Important relationships illustrated
- How to interpret and use the diagram

This documentation can be found in the [docs](docs/) directory.

## Keeping Diagrams Updated

These diagrams should be updated when significant architectural changes are made. When updating:

1. Modify the PlantUML source files
2. Update the corresponding documentation
3. Re-render the diagrams to generate new images
4. Update any related documentation that references the diagrams
