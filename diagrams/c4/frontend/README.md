# Langflow Frontend C4 Diagrams

This directory contains C4 model architecture diagrams specifically for the Langflow frontend system. These diagrams provide various views of the frontend architecture at different levels of detail and from different perspectives.

## Diagram Overview

### Architecture Diagrams

1. **Frontend Component Architecture** (`frontend_component_architecture.puml`)
   - High-level view of the major frontend components
   - Shows the relationships between core systems and UI components
   - Provides a comprehensive overview of the frontend architecture

2. **Frontend State Management** (`frontend_state_management.puml`)
   - Detailed view of the state management system
   - Shows React Context providers, Zustand stores, and React Query
   - Illustrates how state is managed and persisted throughout the application

3. **Frontend Flow System** (`frontend_flow_system.puml`)
   - Detailed view of the flow editor system
   - Shows canvas, node, edge, and selection subsystems
   - Illustrates how the flow editor components integrate together

### Sequence Diagrams

1. **State Management Sequence** (`state_management_sequence.puml`)
   - Shows the flow of state initialization and updates
   - Illustrates interactions between components, contexts, and stores
   - Demonstrates how the frontend manages application state

2. **Flow Editor Lifecycle Sequence** (`flow_editor_lifecycle_sequence.puml`)
   - Shows the lifecycle of the flow editor, from initialization to cleanup
   - Illustrates node creation, configuration, and connection
   - Demonstrates the flow validation and saving process

3. **Playground Execution Sequence** (`playground_execution_sequence.puml`)
   - Shows the execution flow in the playground
   - Illustrates input preparation, flow execution, and result handling
   - Demonstrates conversation management and error handling

4. **API Integration Sequence** (`api_integration_sequence.puml`)
   - Shows how the frontend interacts with the backend API
   - Illustrates data fetching, mutations, and caching
   - Demonstrates error handling and retry mechanisms

5. **Authentication Flow Sequence** (`authentication_flow_sequence.puml`)
   - Shows the authentication process from login to logout
   - Illustrates token management and route protection
   - Demonstrates signup and password reset flows

## Diagram Relationships

These diagrams are interconnected and follow the C4 model hierarchy:

- The **Frontend Component Architecture** provides the highest-level view of frontend components
- The **State Management** and **Flow System** diagrams expand on specific aspects in more detail
- The **Sequence Diagrams** show the dynamic behavior of key processes

## Usage Guide

1. Start with the Frontend Component Architecture to understand the overall frontend structure
2. Explore the State Management and Flow System diagrams for deeper understanding of specific subsystems
3. Reference the sequence diagrams to understand the dynamic behavior of important processes
4. Use these diagrams in conjunction with the backend diagrams to understand the full system

## Naming Consistency

To maintain consistency across the diagrams:

- The same entity name is used across all diagrams (e.g., "Flow Editor")
- Lower-level diagrams maintain the structural boundaries from higher-level diagrams
- Component/container boundaries in detailed diagrams match names in higher-level diagrams

## Relationship to Frontend Code

The diagrams in this directory map to the frontend code in the following way:

- **Components**: Primarily in `src/frontend/src/components/`
- **Pages**: In `src/frontend/src/pages/`
- **Flow Editor**: In `src/frontend/src/pages/FlowPage/` and related components
- **Playground**: In `src/frontend/src/pages/Playground/` and related components
- **State Management**: In `src/frontend/src/contexts/` and `src/frontend/src/stores/`
- **API Integration**: In `src/frontend/src/controllers/API/`

## Updating the Diagrams

When updating the architecture:

1. Ensure changes are reflected consistently across all relevant diagram levels
2. Maintain the naming conventions and hierarchical structure
3. Update this README if the structure or relationships change
4. Re-render the diagrams after making changes
