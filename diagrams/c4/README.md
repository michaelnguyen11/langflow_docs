# Langflow C4 Model Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains the C4 model architecture diagrams for Langflow. The C4 model provides a way to visualize software architecture at different levels of abstraction, from high-level context diagrams to detailed component diagrams.

## Diagram Hierarchy

The C4 model consists of a hierarchical set of diagrams that progressively reveal more detail:

1. **Level 1: Context Diagram**
   - Shows Langflow as a whole system
   - Depicts external users and systems that interact with Langflow
   - Represents the highest level of abstraction

2. **Level 2: Container Diagram**
   - Zooms into Langflow and shows its major containers
   - Shows the high-level technical building blocks
   - Includes the Frontend System, Backend System, and Data Storage

3. **Level 3: Component Diagrams**
   - Shows the components within the main systems
   - Includes details for backend and frontend components

4. **Level 4: Code Diagram**
   - Represents the implementation details (when needed)
   - Maps to actual code structures

## Diagram Relationships

### How the Diagrams Connect

- The **Context Diagram** shows three main systems within Langflow:
  - Frontend System
  - Backend System
  - Data Storage
  
- The **Container Diagram** expands on these systems:
  - **Frontend System** is broken down into UI Components, Core Components, Custom Nodes, State Management, and API Controllers
  - **Backend System** is broken down into API Layer, Component System, Flow Engine, Core System, Component Discovery, Event System, Data Processing, and Services
  - **Data Storage** is broken down into Database, File Storage, and Cache Storage

- The **Component Diagrams** then expand on each container:
  - The **Backend Component Diagram** details the components within each backend container
  - The **Frontend Component Diagram** details the components within each frontend container

## Naming Consistency

To maintain consistency across the diagrams, the following naming conventions are used:

- The same entity name is used across all diagrams (e.g., "API Layer" in the container diagram is also "API Layer" in the component diagram)
- Lower-level diagrams maintain the structural boundaries from higher-level diagrams
- Container boundaries in component diagrams match container names in container diagrams

## Usage Guide

1. Start with the Context Diagram to understand the overall system and its external interactions
2. Move to the Container Diagram to understand the major building blocks
3. Dive into the Component Diagrams to understand specific implementation details
4. Reference the backend and frontend specific diagrams for detailed understanding

## Rendering Instructions

To render these diagrams, use the `render_plantuml.sh` script:

```
./render_plantuml.sh
```

This will generate PNG and SVG versions of all diagrams in the respective `images` directories.

## Updating the Diagrams

When updating the architecture:

1. Ensure changes are reflected consistently across all relevant diagram levels
2. Maintain the naming conventions and hierarchical structure
3. Update this README if the structure or relationships change
4. Re-render the diagrams after making changes
