# Backend Component Diagram

## Overview

The Backend Component Diagram provides a high-level architectural view of the Langflow backend system. It illustrates the main components, their relationships, and how they interact with external systems.

## Diagram Purpose

This C4 component diagram serves to:
- Visualize the major components that make up the Langflow backend
- Show the relationships and dependencies between these components
- Illustrate how the backend interacts with external systems
- Provide a clear understanding of the overall system structure

## Key Components

### Backend Services

The diagram shows the following key backend components:

1. **API Layer** (FastAPI)
   - Provides REST endpoints for frontend interaction
   - Entry point for all client requests

2. **Component System**
   - Manages and executes all AI components
   - Core of Langflow's extensibility features

3. **Flow Engine**
   - Processes and executes workflow graphs
   - Manages the execution order of components

4. **Authentication Service**
   - Handles user authentication and authorization
   - Manages access control

5. **Database Service**
   - Manages data persistence using SQLAlchemy
   - Interfaces with the underlying database

6. **File Service**
   - Handles file operations
   - Manages uploads, downloads, and storage

7. **Execution Service**
   - Manages flow execution and results
   - Coordinates the running of workflows

8. **Event Manager**
   - Handles system events and notifications
   - Enables asynchronous communication between components

### External Systems

The diagram also shows external systems that interact with Langflow:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React/TypeScript user interface

2. **Database**
   - SQLite/PostgreSQL storage

3. **LLM Services**
   - External LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

4. **Vector Stores**
   - Vector databases for embedding storage

5. **External Tools**
   - External services and APIs that can be integrated

## Key Relationships

The diagram illustrates these important relationships:

- The frontend communicates with the backend through the API layer
- The API layer uses various backend services to fulfill requests
- The Flow Engine creates and connects components through the Component System
- The Execution Service executes flows using the Flow Engine
- Components interact with external LLM services, vector stores, and tools
- Database services read from and write to the database
- Auth, File, and Execution services use the Database service

## How to Use This Diagram

This diagram helps different stakeholders understand Langflow's backend architecture:

- **For Developers**: Understand component dependencies and interaction patterns
- **For Architects**: Evaluate the system structure and integration points
- **For DevOps**: Identify deployment boundaries and external dependencies
- **For Product Managers**: Understand system capabilities and extension points

## Rendering the Diagram

To generate this diagram from the PlantUML source:

1. Use the PlantUML online server: paste the contents of `backend_component_diagram.puml` at http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/
2. Use a local PlantUML installation: `java -jar plantuml.jar backend_component_diagram.puml`
3. Use VS Code with the PlantUML extension: open the file and preview
