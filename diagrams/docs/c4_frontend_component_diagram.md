# C4 Frontend Component Diagram for Langflow

## Overview

The C4 Frontend Component diagram illustrates the internal components of the Langflow frontend application and how they interact with the backend services. This diagram focuses on the React/TypeScript application architecture and its communication patterns with the backend.

## Diagram Elements

### Frontend Components

- **Router**: Manages application routing using React Router.
- **Auth Context**: React Context that manages authentication state.
- **API Client**: TypeScript module that communicates with the backend API.
- **Flow Editor**: React component that provides the flow editing interface.
- **Component Sidebar**: React component that lists available components.
- **Node Panel**: React component that configures node properties.
- **Playground**: React component that tests flow execution.
- **Custom Nodes**: React components that represent component nodes in the UI.
- **Custom Edges**: React components that represent connections in the UI.
- **Flow Store**: TypeScript store that manages flow state.
- **Component Store**: TypeScript store that manages component metadata.
- **UI Store**: TypeScript store that manages UI state.
- **Flow Hooks**: React hooks that provide flow functionality.
- **API Hooks**: React hooks that provide API functionality.
- **Auth Hooks**: React hooks that provide authentication functionality.

### Backend Components

- **API Layer**: Handles API endpoints.
- **Component System**: Manages AI components.
- **Flow Engine**: Executes AI workflows.
- **Auth Service**: Handles authentication.
- **File Service**: Manages files and assets.
- **Settings Service**: Manages configuration.

## Key Relationships

### Frontend Internal Relationships

- **Router** routes to **Flow Editor** and **Playground**
- **Flow Editor** uses **Custom Nodes** and **Custom Edges**
- **Flow Editor** includes **Component Sidebar** and **Node Panel**
- **Flow Editor** uses **Flow Store**
- **Component Sidebar** uses **Component Store**
- **Node Panel** updates **Flow Store**
- **Playground** uses **Flow Store**
- **Flow Editor** uses **Flow Hooks**
- **Playground** uses **API Hooks**
- **Router** uses **Auth Hooks**
- **Flow Hooks** manages **Flow Store**
- **API Hooks** uses **API Client**
- **Auth Hooks** uses **Auth Context**
- **Auth Context** provides tokens to **API Client**
- **Flow Store** updates **UI Store**
- **Component Store** fetches component data using **API Client**

### Frontend-Backend Relationships

- **API Client** makes API calls to **API Layer**
- **API Client** interacts with backend components through the **API Layer**:
  - Fetches component metadata from the **Component System**
  - Executes and monitors flows via the **Flow Engine**
  - Authenticates users via the **Auth Service**
  - Uploads and downloads files via the **File Service**
  - Manages settings via the **Settings Service**

### Backend Internal Relationships

- **API Layer** manages components using the **Component System**
- **API Layer** executes flows using the **Flow Engine**
- **API Layer** authenticates via the **Auth Service**
- **API Layer** manages files via the **File Service**
- **API Layer** configures the system via the **Settings Service**

## Component System Emphasis

The diagram shows how the frontend interacts with the Component System:

- The **Component Store** fetches component metadata from the **Component System** via the API
- The **Component Sidebar** displays components from the **Component Store**
- The **Flow Editor** uses components to create nodes in the flow
- The **Playground** executes flows that use components from the Component System

## Purpose

This diagram helps frontend developers understand:

- The structure of the frontend application
- How different parts of the frontend interact with each other
- How the frontend communicates with the backend
- The flow of data through the frontend components
- How user interactions with the frontend trigger backend operations
