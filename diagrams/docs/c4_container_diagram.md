# C4 Container Diagram for Langflow

## Overview

The C4 Container diagram provides a more detailed view of the Langflow system architecture, breaking down the system into containers (applications, data stores, etc.). This diagram helps understand how different parts of the system are structured and how they interact.

## Diagram Elements

### People

- **User**: End users who create and deploy AI workflows using Langflow.
- **Administrator**: System administrators who manage users and configurations.
- **Developer**: Technical users who integrate with Langflow APIs.

### Containers

- **Frontend**: A React/TypeScript application that provides the user interface for building and testing flows.
- **Backend System**:
  - **API Layer**: A FastAPI application that handles API endpoints for frontend interaction.
  - **Component System**: The core system that manages AI components and their interfaces.
  - **Flow Engine**: Executes AI workflows by processing component graphs.
  - **Services**:
    - **Settings Service**: Manages system configuration.
    - **Auth Service**: Handles authentication and authorization.
    - **Database Service**: Manages data persistence.
    - **Queue Service**: Handles background tasks and long-running operations.
    - **Telemetry Service**: Tracks usage and system metrics.
    - **File Service**: Manages uploaded files and assets.
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL database that stores flows, users, and configuration.

### External Systems

- **LLM Provider**: External Large Language Model services.
- **Vector Database**: External vector storage solutions.
- **External Data Source**: Sources of documents and data.
- **Monitoring Tools**: External monitoring tools.
- **External Application**: Third-party applications using Langflow APIs.

## Key Relationships

- Users, Administrators, and Developers interact with Langflow through the Frontend or API Layer.
- The Frontend communicates with the API Layer to perform operations.
- The API Layer uses the Component System to manage components and the Flow Engine to execute flows.
- The Flow Engine creates and connects components using the Component System.
- The API Layer uses various services for authentication, file management, and background tasks.
- The Component System and Flow Engine integrate with external services like LLM providers and vector databases.

## Component System Emphasis

The Component System is the core of the backend architecture, responsible for:

- Managing all AI component types
- Providing interfaces for component discovery and creation
- Handling component metadata extraction and type resolution
- Integrating with external AI services like LLMs and vector databases

## Purpose

This diagram helps stakeholders understand:

- The major containers that make up the Langflow system
- How these containers interact with each other
- The structure of the backend system, with emphasis on the Component System
- The role of various services in supporting the main functionality
- How the system connects to external services and data stores
