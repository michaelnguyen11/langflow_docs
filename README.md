## Architecture Documentation

* [Architecture Overview](architecture/architecture_overview.md) - High-level overview of the Langflow architecture
* [Component System](architecture/component_system.md) - Analysis of the component system
* [Flow Engine](architecture/flow_engine.md) - Documentation of the flow execution engine
* [API and Services](architecture/api_and_services.md) - Details of the API endpoints and backend services

## Implementation Documentation

* [Backend Architecture](backend/backend_architecture.md) - Details of the Python/FastAPI backend
* [Frontend Architecture](frontend/frontend_architecture.md) - Details of the React/TypeScript frontend

## Deployment and Integration

* [Deployment Architecture](deployment/deployment_architecture.md) - AWS deployment architecture and integrations

## C4 Model Diagrams

The C4 model provides a way to visualize software architecture at different levels of abstraction:

* [Context Diagram](diagrams/c4/c4_context_diagram.puml) - System context (Level 1)
* [Container Diagram](diagrams/c4/c4_container_diagram.puml) - Containers within the system (Level 2)
* [Component Diagram - Backend](diagrams/c4/c4_component_diagram.puml) - Backend components (Level 3)
* [Component Diagram - Frontend](diagrams/c4/c4_frontend_component_diagram.puml) - Frontend components (Level 3)
* [Code Diagram](diagrams/c4/c4_code_diagram.puml) - Key classes and relationships (Level 4)
* [AWS Deployment Diagram](diagrams/c4/aws_deployment_diagram.puml) - AWS deployment architecture

## Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams show the dynamic behavior of the system from different perspectives:

### Frontend Sequence Diagrams
* [Authentication](diagrams/sequence/frontend/frontend_auth_sequence.puml) - User authentication flow
* [Flow Creation](diagrams/sequence/frontend/frontend_flow_create_sequence.puml) - Creating a new flow
* [Flow Execution](diagrams/sequence/frontend/frontend_flow_execution_sequence.puml) - Executing a flow in the playground

### Backend Sequence Diagrams
* [Flow Execution](diagrams/sequence/backend/backend_flow_execution_sequence.puml) - Backend flow execution process
* [Component Loading](diagrams/sequence/backend/backend_component_loading_sequence.puml) - Component discovery and registration
* [Auth Middleware](diagrams/sequence/backend/backend_auth_middleware_sequence.puml) - Authentication and authorization process

### User Perspective Diagrams
* [Flow Creation and Testing](diagrams/sequence/user/user_flow_creation_sequence.puml) - User's journey creating and testing a flow
* [API Usage](diagrams/sequence/user/user_api_usage_sequence.puml) - Using Langflow APIs in applications

### Developer Perspective Diagrams
* [Custom Component](diagrams/sequence/developer/developer_custom_component_sequence.puml) - Creating and using custom components
* [API Integration](diagrams/sequence/developer/developer_api_integration_sequence.puml) - Integrating with Langflow APIs

### Administrator Perspective Diagrams
* [User Management](diagrams/sequence/admin/admin_user_management_sequence.puml) - Managing users and permissions
* [System Configuration](diagrams/sequence/admin/admin_system_configuration_sequence.puml) - Configuring system settings
* [Monitoring](diagrams/sequence/admin/admin_monitoring_sequence.puml) - Monitoring system performance and activity

## Viewing PlantUML Diagrams

To view the PlantUML diagrams, you can use:

1. [PlantUML Online Server](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
2. VS Code with the PlantUML extension
3. IntelliJ IDEA with the PlantUML plugin
4. Command line using the PlantUML JAR

## Key Architectural Insights

1. **Modular Design** - The system is built with clear separation of concerns
2. **Component-Based Architecture** - Extensible component system for AI capabilities
3. **Visual Flow Engine** - Graph-based workflow representation and execution
4. **Service-Oriented Backend** - Well-defined services with specific responsibilities
5. **Modern Frontend** - React/TypeScript application with component-based UI

## Extending Langflow

The documentation provides insights for:

1. Adding new component types
2. Customizing the execution engine
3. Extending the API
4. Modifying the frontend interface
5. Integrating with external systems
